## Cakephp Products Plugin ##

The Products plugin is a building-block plugin that should be the de-facto standard for products for use mainy with the CakeDC Cart plugin, but you may be able to use it in your own applications with minimal modification. This plugin requires the CakeDC search plugin, and the Bmilesp file_system plugin, both also available on gitub. Also requires jQuery for the admin and product element rollover effects.

The Plugin contains an admin system for easily adding products and images, and contains default product elements and basic css. 

For out of the box functionality to work, you may have to add an 'Image' folder into you webroot/img/ folder set to chmod 777.
